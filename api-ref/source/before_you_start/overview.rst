Overview
========

Welcome to Distributed Database Middleware (DDM). This document describes functions, syntax, parameters, and examples of DDM.

If you plan to access DDM through an API, ensure that you are familiar with DDM concepts.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform creating, querying, deleting, and updating operations.

.. note::

   -  This document will be updated when APIs of new functions are added, for example, adding response parameters.
   -  To reduce impacts caused by API changes, DDM is backward compatible with existing APIs. When using DDM, you should accept and ignore unused parameters and parameter values in JSON responses.
