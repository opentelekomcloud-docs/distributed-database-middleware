Application Scenarios
=====================

It is especially suitable for applications requiring high-concurrency access to large volumes of data. Typical application scenarios are as follows:

-  **Internet**

   E-commerce, finance, O2O, retail, and social networking applications usually face challenges such as large user base, frequent marketing events, and slow response of core transactional systems. DDM can scale compute and storage resources to improve database processing of high-concurrency transactions and ensure fast access to data.

-  **IoT**

   In industrial monitoring, remote control, smart city extension, smart home, and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios, a large number of sensors and monitoring devices frequently collect data and generate huge amounts of data, which may exceed the storage capability of single-node databases. DDM provides horizontal expansion to help you store massive data at low costs.

-  **Traditional sectors**

   Government agencies, large-sized enterprises, banks, and the like usually use commercial solutions to support high-concurrency access to large volumes of data. These solutions are expensive because they need to rely on mid-range computers and high-end storage devices. DDM, deployed in clusters with common ECSs, provides cost-efficient database solutions with the same or even higher performance than traditional commercial database solutions.
