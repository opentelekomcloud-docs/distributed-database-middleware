Network Access
==============

Restrictions on network access are as follows:

-  The data nodes and ECSs running your applications must be in the same VPC as your DDM instance.
-  To access DDM from your computer, you need to bind an EIP to your DDM instance and then use the EIP to access the DDM instance.
