Restarting a Node
=================

You can restart a single node of your DDM instance.

An instance is not available when one of its nodes is being restarted. The restart operation cannot be undone. Exercise caution when you restart an instance node.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  You have logged in to the DDM console.
-  There is a DDM instance available, and its nodes are normal.

Procedure
---------

#. In the instance list, locate the DDM instance whose node you want to restart and click its name.
#. In the **Node Information** area, locate the target node and click **Restart** in the **Operation** column.
#. In the displayed dialog box, click **Yes**.
#. Wait until the node is restarted.
