Reloading Table Data
====================

Prerequisites
-------------

You have logged in to the DDM console.

Scenarios
---------

If you want to deploy a DDM instance across regions for DR, use DRS to migrate service data and then reload table data after the migration is complete so that DDM can detect where logical table information is stored.

Procedure
---------

#. Choose **Instances** on the left navigation pane, in the instance list, locate the instance whose information is changed and click the instance name.
#. Choose **More** > **Reload Table Data** in the **Operation** column.
