Overview
========

Managing data nodes is managing RDS for MySQL or GaussDB(for MySQL) instances that are associated with your DDM instance. You can view the instance status, storage, class, and read weight, configure read weights, and create read replicas on the data node management page.

You can set read weights for multiple data nodes in the list at the same time. If a data node has no read replicas, you cannot set read weights for its primary RDS instance.

Synchronize data node changes to your DDM instance after you make changes like adding or deleting a read replica, or changing the connection address, port number, or security group.
